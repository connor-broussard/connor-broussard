- I’m @connor-broussard
- I’m currently working as a Data Scientist in Cell Therapy Manufacturing Analytics at Bristol Myers Squibb.
- My background is in Chemical and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan - there I learned the importance of data modeling in relation to understanding process robustness and areas for improvement, specially around statistical process control and Six Sigma.
- I’m interested in this cross-section between traditional chemical and biomedical engineering and data science - from industry experience, data is the backbone of any organization and data science helps provide the right way to extract insights from it.
- I'm hoping to use this repository to store my work related to data science/biostatistics in relation to the biotech industry!
